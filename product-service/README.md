For integration test TestContainers framework is used.

Testcontainers is an open source framework for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker container.

No more need for mocks or complicated environment configurations. Define your test dependencies as code, then simply run your tests and containers will be created and then deleted.
